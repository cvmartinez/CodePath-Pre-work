# Prework - *CodePath pre-work*

Submitted by: **Carlos Valdez**

**CodePath pre-work** is an app that... [TODO] 
I made the color generation logic inline within the changeBackgroundColor method to simplify the code. The generateRandomColor method is kept as a private helper function for clarity. This code still achieves the same functionality of changing the background color randomly when the button is tapped.
Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [√ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ √] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
* My three favorite apps are Instagram, Spotify, and Tesla App.
* Instagram
    - Their interface is simple and easy to use.
    - Instagram is intagrated well with facebook and is easy to share posts between the two apps.
* Spotify
    - Spotify's algorithm to prompt new music and music I might like.
    - How easy it is to great playists within your liked songs.
* Tesla App
    - Tesla's car app allows you to know about your car all within your phone. Their interface is simple.
    - Getting alerts about my car, if that is battery, tempature, software updates, and if the doors are open. 

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The only difficulty I had while building the app was finding certain instructions on xcode. For example the control+drag. I was a bit confused and thought the code should be there once I highlighted the buttom. After playing around with it I figured it out.
